cd very/deeply
exec runme ls --project ../..
cmp stdout relative.txt
! stderr .

-- very/deeply/nested/file.md --
```sh {"name":"echo"}
$ echo "Hello, runme!"
```
-- very/deeply/sub.md --
It can contain multiple lines too:

```sh {"interactive":"false","name":"count"}
$ echo "1"
$ echo "2"
$ echo "3"
```
-- very/another.md --
```sh {"name":"again"}
echo "Hello, runme! Again!"
```

runme:
  id: 01HFVTDBE512K2HREH9ZJGQB57
  version: 2.0
---

It can even run scripting languages:

```js {"name":"hello-js","excludeFromRunAll":"true"}
console.log("Hello, runme, from javascript!")
```

And it can even run a cell with a custom interpreter:

```js {"interpreter":"cat","name":"hello-js-cat"}
console.log("Hello, runme, from javascript!")
```

It works with `cd`, `pushd`, and similar because all lines are executed as a single script:

```sh
temp_dir=$(mktemp -d -t "runme-XXXXXXX")
pushd $temp_dir
echo "hi!" > hi.txt
pwd
cat hi.txt
popd
pwd
```

## Go

It can also execute a snippet of Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go, runme!")
}
```

## Python

```python {"interpreter":"python3","name":"hello-python"}
def say_hi():
  print("Hello from Python")

say_hi()
```
